# notes

## neovim updates needed

1. need auto-closing brackets and quotes
2. need tab to accept autocompletion suggestions
3. some way to auto-refresh directory listing when something (claude, bun init) creates a new file?
4. remove ".git" from neotree listing
5. slightly larger tabs?
6. <leader>sa to search in all files (ignoring node_modules, .git, etc.)
7. find in folder!
8. line spacing!!!
9. telescope needs to be able to look at dotfiles (no .git obviously)
10. remove <leader>s. for recent files. this doesn't seem too useful

maybe's

1. better error/diagnostics. can I hover to view the message and details?
2. theming -- is it possible to gray/dim out the shebang at the top of executables? use same theming from comments
3. markdown -- any way to have continuous lists? i.e. I create a newline after starting a list and the next number/bullet appears?
4. theming -- more padding between tabs and text

### neovim in the future

1. maybe remove the need for neotree altogether? just a single pane of text and use telescope to get around? can you use telescope to visualize the filetree? that's what's mostly helpful with neotree

## ghostty updates needed

1. need pane shortcuts https://danielmiessler.com/blog/replacing-cursor-with-neovim-claude-code
2. any way to set up presets for panes?
